        <p class="paragraph">
          A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or
          data. It has the
          <span>ability to store, retrieve, and process data</span>. You may
          already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send
          email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or
          create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.
